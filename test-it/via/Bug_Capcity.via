/*
 When switching arrays to track capacity one lingering bug
 related to non flat elements in extra capacity section of an array.
 for variable and fixed arrays this was not a problem since length matched
 capacity, but for bounded arrays it did not work right.

 Extra capacity is initialized during the array's initial allocation, and must be
 deleted when the array is freed up. This is particularly important when the array
 elements are non flat.
