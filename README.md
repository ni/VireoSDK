A compact parallel execution runtime for VIs saved in VI assembly format (.via files).

The Vireo project provides a subset of LabVIEW runtime functionality for smaller targets. Example usages are WebVIs and the EV3 support in the _LabVIEW Module for LEGO® MINDSTORMS®_. The LabVIEW features supported are primarily defined by the features needed for the VIA files generated by LabVIEW NXG.

# Building

Requirements:
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (> v4.4.7)
- [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten) (v1.37.9)
- make

Setup:
- `npm install`

Setup (Windows):
You need some UNIX command tools. [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) is a good option to get them. Once you have it, run:
- `choco install make`
- `choco install gnuwin32-coreutils.portable`

#### Visual Studio
Works with Visual Studio 2013 and 2015 (see the `Vireo_VS` folder).

### Easy Build
*`esh & vireo.js`*

From the root directory (on Linux only):
```console
$ make
```
The `esh` and `vireo.js` files will be put into the `./dist` directory based on the build configuration.

For example the default vireo.js output of `TARGET=asmjs-unknown-emscripten` and `BUILD=release` will be:
`./dist/asmjs-unknown-emscripten/release/vireo.js`

#### Build Native Binary (on Linux only)
```console
$ make native
```

#### Build JavaScript File
```console
$ make js
```

To create a debug build of vireo.js you can change the BUILD variable passed to the make command. For example:
```console
$ make js BUILD=debug
```

# Testing
From the root directory (Runs all tests for Native and JS):

```console
$ make test
```

## Running Tests
From within the `test-it` directory:

#### Against esh target (`-n`)
```console
$ node ./test.js -n
```

or (from root directory)
```console
$ make testnative
```

#### Against vireo.js target (`-j`)
```console
$ node ./test.js -j
```

or (from root directory)
```console
$ make testjs
```

#### Running Test Suites (`-t [test suite]`)
```console
$ node ./test.js -n -t <test suite>
```

#### Run Individual Tests (`[Test].via`)
```console
$ node ./test.js HelloWorld.via
```

#### Run Karma tests
```console
$ npm run test
```

#### Listing Out Tests (`-l [test suite]`)
Since the test suites can be created recursively from other test suites in the configuration file, the `-l` command line argument will list out all of the tests to be run with the test suite name provided. Example:
```console
$ node ./test.js -l native
```
Will list out all of the tests that would be run against the `native` test suite.

## Test Help
```console
$ node ./test.js -h
Usage: node ./test.js [options] [via test files]
Options:
 -n                  Run the tests against the native vireo target (esh)
 -j                  Run the tests against the JavaScript target (vireo.js)
 -t [test suite]     Run the tests in the given test suite
 -l [test suite]     List the tests that would be run in given test suite,
                        or list the test suite options if not provided
 -e                  Execute the test suite or tests provided and show their
                        raw output; do not compute pass/fail
 -h                  Print this usage message
 --once              Will only run the tests once (default is to run twice)
```

## Adding Tests

#### Test Configuration
The `.via` test files are put in the `test-it/ViaTests` folder and the results from the stdout of the test `.via` file from vireo is put in a file of the same name inside the `test-it/ExpectedResults/` folder. The test name is then added to a test suite within the `testList.json` file in the `test-it` directory.

The `testList.json` file has two properties that are required for each test suite name:

##### include
This is an array of strings that are names to other test suites. These test suite names are processed recursively to add the other tests together into one list of tests to run. (Duplicates are omitted if overlaps exists between tests)

##### tests
This is an array of strings that contain the list of `.via` files that the test suite should run.

#### Adding a Test Suite
This will be a simple example that will add the test suite `rpi` with the `RpiTest.via` file to the test manager.

1. Put the `RpiTest.via` in the `test-it/ViaTests` folder and put the `RpiTest.vtr` file in the `test-it/ExpectedResults` folder.
2. Then add this example code to the `testList.json` file:
```json
"rpi": {
    "include": [ "common" ],
    "tests": [
        "RpiTest.via"
    ]
}
```
This will add a test suite `rpi` that will include the test `RpiTest.via` and all of the tests included in the `common` test suite.

3. Try it out to verify it all works and your tests pass:
```console
$ node ./test.js -n -t rpi
```

## Running the HTTP test server

### Overview
Vireo tests rely on a locally running instance of the [httpbin](https://httpbin.org/) server for testing the HTTP Client functionality. If the httpbin server is not running locally, the test suite will skip tests that rely on it. If you would like to run the HTTP client tests locally these instructions show you how to do so.

### Requirements
- Python 2.7.9 or later (primarily for pip availability)
- Pip package manager

### Setup
1. Ensure that python (correct version) and pip are available on the path
2. From a command line in the VireoSDK directory or elsewhere do `pip install tox` to globally install the [tox](http://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) tool

### Starting the Server
1. Open a command prompt in the VireoSDK directory
2. Run the `npm run httpbin` command. This will install dependencies of httpbin if necessary and start the httpbin server locally.

   Note: On Windows you can alternatively execute `npm run httpbin-start` to start the httpbin server in a new console window.
3. With the server running in a new window now you can run the tests that rely on the HTTP client (ie `npm run test` and `make testhttpbin`)

## Updating Vireo Documentation
We are using the [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) tool to generate our documentation. This tool allows to annotate our source code and generate documentation from it. We are currently using version *1.8.6*.

Installers can be found [here](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html). On Windows use the 64-bit version.

Once Doxygen is installed run the following command from any directory in the repo

```console
$ npm run doxygen
```

It will find and use the Doxyfile file in the source directory and will generate the documentation files in the following directory

*`gh-pages`*
	
The main html file in the `gh-pages` is called: index.html

## Setting up Vireo CI builds in a fork
When you create a Vireo fork, Travis and AppVeyor CIs are not enabled in your fork by default. They are helpful because they validate your work and ensure there are not breaking changes when you do a pull request to Vireo master.

Here are the steps to enable the CIs on your fork:

### Travis-CI
1. Go to [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/first_sync) website and login with the github account associated with your Vireo fork
2. (If this is your first time logging in, you can skip this step) On the left side of the page that appears click on the + sign, right next to My repositories
3. On the page that appears, click on the repository switch to enable it

### AppVeyor-CI
1. Go to the [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) website and login with the github account associated with your Vireo fork
2. At the top of the page, click on "add a new project".
3. On the page that appears, select your repository.
